Information about the data :
Wine Quality Data Set from UCI Machine Learning Lab
There are two datasets that provide information on samples of red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. Each sample of wine was rated for quality by wine experts and examined with physicochemical tests.
Due to privacy and logistic issues, only data on these physicochemical properties and quality ratings are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.)

Attributes in Each Dataset:
#	Physicochemical Properties
1	Fixed Acidity
2	Volatile Acidity
3	Citric Acid
4	Residual Sugar
5	Chlorides
6	Free Sulfur Dioxide
7	Total Sulfur Dioxide
8	Density
9	pH
10	Sulphates
11	Alcohol

#	Quality Rating
12	Quality - Score between 0 and 10 (median of at least 3 evaluations made by wine experts)


In the EDA part we did answer some intersting questions like :

Q1: Is a certain type of wine (red or white) associated with higher quality?
Q2: What level of acidity (pH value) receives the highest average rating?
Q3: Do wines with higher alcoholic content receive better ratings?
Q4: Do sweeter wines (more residual sugar) receive better ratings?
